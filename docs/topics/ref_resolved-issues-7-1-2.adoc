= Resolved issues

This section provides highlighted issues that have been resolved in {ProductFullName} 7.1.1.

.Application analysis no longer fails when run with the `--bulk` option

Previously, if you ran an application analysis with the `--bulk` option, it failed with the following error:
----
ERRO[0143] container run error
ERRO[0143] failed to generate static report
----

With this update, the issue has been resolved, and the bulk analysis completes without errors and generates a proper analysis report. Note, however, that the bulk analysis still fails on Windows systems. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-3663[MTA-3663])

.Enabling Preemption now works as expected if authentication is enabled

Previously, *Preemption* could not be enabled for tasks in the *Task Manager* page and the Task Manager drawer if {ProductFullName} authentication was enabled. With this update, the issue has been resolved, and you can now enable *Preemption* if {ProductShortName} authentication is enabled.(link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-3195[MTA-3195])

.The drop-down application menu no longer contains duplicate options

Previously, when selecting a target for application analysis, the drop-down menu contained duplicate application target options. With this update, the issue has been resolved, and no duplicates are listed when selecting the application analysis target. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2795[MTA-2795])

.The Reports page now displays separate charts for unassessed applications and applications with the Unknown risk

Previously, the {ProductFullName} user interface (UI) did not distinguish between unassessed applications and applications that have been assessed to have the `Unknown` risk. Consequently, the *Reports* page displayed a single chart for such applications. With this update, the issue has been resolved, and the *Reports* page now displays separate charts for unassessed applications and applications with the *Unknown* risk. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-2678[MTA-2678])

.Fixed issue where some analysis with custom rules were returning an error

Previously, when you ran an analysis for public applications, which did not require credentials, by using custom rules, the analysis would fail if no targets and maven or source credentials were provided. With this update, the issue has been resolved, and the analysis no longer fails for public applications. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-3163[MTA-3163])

.Application analysis no longer fails when dependency analysis failures occur

Previously, the application analysis failed due to a dependency analysis issue, even when the source code analysis was successful, resulting in no static report being generated. This issue has been resolved now in the {ProductShortName} CLI. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-3700[MTA-3700])

.Improved container naming

Previously, container names contained random letters, making their identification difficult. The issue has been resolved in {ProductShortName} 7.1.1, where container names now have readable prefixes for easier identification. (link:https:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-3133[MTA-3133])

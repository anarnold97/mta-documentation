= About data use

{mta-dl-plugin} is a virtual assistant you interact with using natural language. Using the {mta-dl-plugin} interface, you send chat messages that {mta-dl-plugin} transforms and sends to the large language model (LLM) provider you have configured for your environment.

These messages could potentially contain information provided by your users about themselves, your cluster, cluster resources, or other aspects of your business or working environment.

{mta-dl-plugin} has limited capabilities to filter or redact the code snippets you provide to the LLM.

Do not enter information into {mta-dl-plugin} that you do not want to send to the LLM provider.

Analysis precision is lower when the project cannot be built for whatever reasons. This lowering of precision can be caused by several factors:

* The lack of a proper build file, such as, a `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file. For example, running {ProductFullName} on a project with an inaccessible parent `pom.xml` file may not result in a full analysis.
* Compilation errors of one form or another.
